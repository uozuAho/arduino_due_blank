Arduino SDK licenses
====================

This project mostly contains files copied from the Arduino SDK 
(everything in arduino_core/ and device_libs/).

The files within the Arduino SDK come from a variety of sources, with a 
variety of licenses. Atmel's stuff seems to be permissively licensed,
while the rest is covered by the GPL or LGPL.

In short, I think this means:
- If you use GPL code, you must provide your source code on request 
  (is that freedom?)
- If you use LGPL code, you must provide your code's object files on 
  request
- If you use BSD, MIT or other permissively licensed code, you don't
  have to provide anything. However if you intend on redistributing
  the source code you use, you must keep any copyright notices intact.

Other files' license
====================

I believe in a more free form of freedom than the GPL/LGPL, so all 
non-Arduino files in this project (everything not in arduino_core/ 
and device_libs/) are covered by an MIT-ish license 
(http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). In short:

- You can use these files in any way you like, just give me some credit 
  when you use this project so people know how good I am! (ie. keep any
  copyright notices in any files intact)
